# upgrade os
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade

# Download the right script and install Docker on the Raspberry Pi environment. 
Push this below installation script.
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh

# Run the script with the help of the below command:
sudo sh get-docker.sh

# Append a non-root user on the Docker group
As per the Raspberry Pi process, whichever user has the administrative rights whom we can consider as root user can execute containers. For example, if a case user is not logged in to the admin root, then they should use the sudo prefix.
We can also add the non-root users to the Docker group, which will enable running the executed docker commands.
Here is the syntax for adding users to the Docker group:

sudo usermod -aG docker [user_name]

# We can consider it the default user for adding the Pi user in Raspbian.
Refer to the below command:
sudo usermod -aG docker Pi
usermod -aG docker pi
usermod -aG docker root

# We need to log out of the system to check the output process.
For checking the Updated Docker Version and info details on your Raspberry Pi, refer to the below command.
docker version

# Execute/run the sample Hello World Container. Here we need to configure and set up this below command.

docker run hello-world

# After running the above command, it will contact the Docker daemon and pull the “hello-world” image. 
The output will show the “installation appears to be working correctly” message.

# install screen
apt-get install screen
